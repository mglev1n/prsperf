# Estimate Maximal AUC

This function allows the user to estimate the maximal AUC based on population prevalence (`K`) and proportion of variance explained (`pve`).


Here, we can use the example of type II diabetes provided in the original manuscript:

```{r example-max_auc}
max_auc(k = 0.13, pve = 0.26)
```

  

  
  

# Estimate optimal sensitivity

This function estimates the optimal (maximal or minimal) sensitivity of a PRS


```{r example-opt_se}
opt_se(k = 0.13, pve = 0.26, sp = 0.99)
```

  

  

# Estimate optimal specificity

    

  

```{r example-opt_sp}
opt_sp(k = 0.13, pve = 0.26, se = 0.99)
```
